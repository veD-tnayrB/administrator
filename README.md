## Getting Started

To get started with this template, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/veD-tnayrB/administrator.git

cd administrator
```

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd client
yarn
cd ..
```

```bash
cd server
npm i
cd ..
```

```bash
# Install beyond
npm i -g beyond
```

```bash
# Run the application
beyond run
```

### Setting the environment

To set the server credentials you need to go to `server` and based on the `.env.example` file create a .env file with
your own credentials and thats it

To set the client credentials u need to based on the `client/firebase-messaging-sw-example.js` file create your own
`firebase-messaging-sw.js` based on that structure with u own credentials, this is for the service worker of firebase so
the notifications works

And go to `client/modules/serverless-provider-setup/serverless-provider-setup/` check the
`firebase-credentials-example.ts` file and create your `firebase-credentials.ts` file with the same structure but with
your own credentials

and you are ready

Then go to `http://localhost:6550/`
